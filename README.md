# ComplaintesForm
I created this project for my current job, it is a complaint form that unifies the look and feel of the complaint form within the company.
The form adapts to the need to depend on "Guarantee , Warranty , Repair against payment , pre-sale " by adding the removal of specific inputs. 
In addition, the project has a calculator that makes it easier to count the cash at the end of the day by entering the appropriate amount of money from the rapot and counting the corresponding amount of money.
